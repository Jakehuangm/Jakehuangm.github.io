Before starting doing this project, I need to plan out what I should have for each sence, and design what motions the charac- ter should have in different senses. For the main character that I made in my AI project, I separate his body to different layers because different part of his part would havev different motions. eventually, I am satisfied that the characters that I made be- come vivid characters in the screen.
