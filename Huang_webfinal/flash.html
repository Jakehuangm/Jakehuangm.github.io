This homeworkâ€™s requirement was to create a simple animation that had about 10s long. Even though it is a very short video, I realized that I need to plan what would happened for each scene, such as characters, background music, sounds and movements. Furthermore, I would consider use text to collaborate with the elements in the animation.</p> 
        &ensp;
<p>It is very interesting to create this animation, I hope I could have more time (this project needed be finished in 2 days because of summer school) to plan about it and make more interesting movements to make it more vivid.
