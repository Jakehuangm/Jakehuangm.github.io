  It is the first time that I create my own charecter. I drew it looking like a dog, and put equipment on him which makes him look like a gaming character.be-
cause this character is consist of different irregular shape, I needed to do a lot of intersection to create each part of the body. Finally, when putting all the shapes together, he looks great.
