  I have taken basic drawing and figure drawing class in San Francisco of City College, but I had not tried to design a character for a long period until I got this assignment which is to design a character by using Adobe Illustrator.
</p>&ensp;
        
        <p>The inspiration for this drawing was that I like dog very much, so I tried to draw something that is like a dog but has human characteristics. Probably, I played so many Japanese video game when I was a child; therefore, this character would look like Japanese style.</p>&ensp;
        
        <p>Because it was the first time I use Adobe Illustrator for drawing, I didnâ€™t create a character that was too complicated. What I learned from this software is that if people want to get a logo which would be used on different size of the product, Adobe Illustrator would be a great choice because Adobe Illustrator is a vector program which means no matter how the image enlarge, the quality of the image will not be changed at all.</p>
