  In this project, I have learn how to use text and picture together to make a slice show. I found that I need to be careful about the style and the colors of the font because if I use the font that is not fit the theme of my project, they look not unified to the design. I mainly use blue and orange in my project because some project that I did had orange and blue. Therefore, if I use these colors, they look that they belong to each other. I love doing this project since it is the first time I do the project like this.
