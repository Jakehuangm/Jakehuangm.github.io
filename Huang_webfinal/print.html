The purpose of this assignment was to introduce what we had done in the first half of the Visual Media Design 105. I must use two master pages or two kind of layout for the assignment, and one master page was used to place my homework and another master page was to place the description about the homework.

</p>

<p>What I learned from this experience was that Adobe InDesign is a very proper tool to design something like books, slice shows or eBooks. For instance, if a designer wants to change the font of an eBook, he/she can simply change the font in the master page, and he/she doesnâ€™t need to apply this setting to every page.</p>
